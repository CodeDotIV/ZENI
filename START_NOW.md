# 🚀 Start ZENI Now!

## ✅ Services Starting...

I've started the services for you. Here's how to access them:

## 🌐 **OPEN IN YOUR BROWSER:**

### **Main Application:**
# 👉 http://localhost:3000 👈

**This is your ZENI interface!**

## 📋 Quick Status

- ✅ **Frontend**: Starting at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ **AI Service**: Starting at http://localhost:8000
- ⚠️ **Backend**: Needs dependencies installed first

## 🔧 To Complete Setup:

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies (Required)

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/yellutla1.kumar/Desktop/app1/backend
npm install
```

If you get permission errors:
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
cd /Users/yellutla1.kumar/Desktop/app1/backend
npm install
```

### 2. Start Backend API

After dependencies are installed:

```bash
cd /Users/yellutla1.kumar/Desktop/app1/backend
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 What You Can Do Right Now

Even without the backend, you can:
1. **Open http://localhost:3000** in your browser
2. See the landing page
3. View the UI (some features will need backend)

Once backend is running:
- Sign up / Login
- Complete onboarding
- Chat with ZENI
- Create tasks
- Use all features!

## 🔍 Check Service Status

```bash
# Check if services are running
curl http://localhost:3000        # Frontend
curl http://localhost:3001/health # Backend (after starting)
curl http://localhost:8000/health # AI Service
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Open your browser** → http://localhost:3000
2. **Install backend deps** (see above)
3. **Start backend** (see above)
4. **Enjoy ZENI!** 🎉
